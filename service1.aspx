	A lush green lawn is the crowning glory for any home, but lawn maintenance can be time consuming and downright frustrating for many homeowners. Employing a Lawn Care expert means that you can expect great results without the headache. <br>If you have ever tried to treat your lawn yourself, then you'll know the many pitfalls that you can encounter:<br><br><br><br><br>
•	What kind of lawn fertiliser should you use?<br>
•	When should you apply the fertiliser?<br>
•	How much fertiliser should you use?<br>
•	How should it be applied?<br>
•	Can you do this by hand or should you buy a spreader?<br>
•	What happens if it does or doesn't rain when you are treating the lawn?<br>
•	What about those annoying weeds?<br>
•	Why do some weeds die and others don’t?<br>
•	Why is there lots of moss on the lawn?<br>
•	Why has nothing happened at all?<br><br><br>
