	Not all insects are our gardens enemies, the Lady Bird insect can indeed be highly beneficial to us by preying on other creatures which damage crops or flowers like the Green Flies. We all would prefer the idea of having a wildlife friendly garden and that’s why it’s becoming more popular by the day. There are some real villains like the Vine Weevils and New Zealand Flatworms being the most noted to date. These two add to their dastardliness by the fact that they do not need a mate to reproduce, which means that if only one individual is brought into the garden then they can instantly establish themselves. These are a few new aliens who have been spotted recently in gardens across the UK, they present a massive problem to us with these introduced species that are not part of the existing food chain and not having a natural predator means they can spread quickly. Our biggest defence against them is our climate, which fortunately kills off most of the creatures accidently carried here on plants or in food imports, so we need to be extra vigilant.<br><br>
